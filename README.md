##Intro
**APEX Client Side Validation plugin** was created due to lack of core functionality that allows user to run APEX defined validations **on the fly (live)** in APEX 4.x and 5.x.

**The plugin is dynamic action plugin that allows user to validate form data according to defined APEX validations without submitting the page**. APEX item validations can be executed "on the fly" (eg. after leaving the textfield) and do not require pressing submit button and reloading the page.


##Features at a Glance
* Live validation for APEX Items;
* Integrated with standard APEX item validations;
* Auto-executing validations on dependent APEX items;
* Easy to install and use (without single line of JavaScript);
* Easy to implement for entire application by dynamic action on Page 0;
* Ready to use templates for validation result handling;
* Possibility to define custom validation result handling through JS callback function;
* Possibility to track every step of validation through jQuery events;
* Runs on APEX 4.x and 5.x.

##Roadmap
* Implementing debounce mechanism for "key release" event;
* New templates for validation result handling;
* Plugin attributes customization on application and page level;
* Handling APEX page validations (not associated with APEX items).
